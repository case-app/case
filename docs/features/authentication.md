# Authentication

CASE provides an authentication system out of the box.

## Dummy data

When working on local development, you can use the [database seeder](../resources/database-seeder.md) command `npm run seed` to generate a batch of users that you can use to login in the application. The names and emails of the generated users are random, but the first user that is always the same :

email: *admin@case.app*
password: _case_
